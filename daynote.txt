[Daily notes]

2021-02-06
- Today I finally start this note.
- I don't have clear idea what to write, and I am sure things will evolve.
- I decided not to think about technology too much for this note. Once the content is generated, and if there is a growing need for technology, then I will think about how to adopt technology.
- These days I have a concern that I don't do anything. I usually think unclearly and do not initiate any action. And, usually I compromise with current situation
- I feel sorry about YA Kim on how I treated her, however I still feel this is the best way for all of us. 
- Am I also doing good to JS Lee? Is she doing well? Should I talk to her upright?
- Writing is fun
- What should be my focus? What do I have to develop? 
- Is my network too limited? Will there be really things that I can do only by myself? Should I reach out to others more actively?
- Fear of left out: is this only for investment? Or for other areas as well?
- Investment: how to double the assets? What are my investment preferences. Am I rational in approaching investment? What will be the proper principles.

<> Daily conclusions/actions
- Need to act. Do not think about the same topic over and over again. 
- Be determined 
- Keep good relationship with JSL, but terminate with YAK
- Paint more drawings. Order more canvases and maybe more art supplies.
- Draw 5th paining today
- Think systematically about investment principles: this may evolve over time. Create a new section/file for this

2021-02-07
- I have reached to a thought that "not only stuffs but also thoughts have to
  be cleaned up"
- I have determined to do my best for KE / Need actions for (1) gifts, (2)
  formal start, (3) valentine day prep - reservation, etc. 
- Let's think about renting a shop, business plan, and budgeting
- Making vim settings: set spell

2021-02-09
- Waiting for a downturn of a market is probably not a good idea: as nobody knows when it will come and it could come pretty late
- Would portfolio strategy be better

2021-03-01
- I came back to this note in a month
- Lots of things happened: 
    (1) Regarding coin-investment and huge fluctuation in gain/loss: 
        Bitcoin investment had reached to 0.2B KRW gain, but collapsed in almost in 24 hours. 
        After that, market became so sluggish - I made lots of mistakes, so the return eventually went to negative. 
        All expectations turn out to be wrong. Purchases on the spot almost always were wrong, and cancelled orders were almost always good. 
        Almost extra moves I made turn out to be wrong.
        However, purchasing at any time and holding seem beneficial in the long run.
        In rapid drop / increase situation, it is hard to think rationally; greed and fear smear
        * I have to codify my past/current decision rationals and their effects to apply to my future decisions
        * Think about how to make this a sustainable investment/job that generates reasonable returns/Or is this by nature a one time thing for a high gain? 
        * What will be my logic in making decisions: should I set target returns and buy/sell mechanically? - sounds not quite right...
    (2) Stance changed to people around me
        Many new people appeared
        I have to maintain good relationships with gentleman-ship and have to make firm stances at times
    (3) Thinking evolved that I have to engage more with JC
        I may stay longer as the perspective on KDBL is not bad and I have to be responsible
        Also, my current position toward/with KDBL is firm, which is a big advantage
        Anyway, it is good to do my best 
- Few initial thoughts regarding my coin-investments
    Taking advantage of volatility is hard: it never (or not easily) reaches my resell target price
    Alt coin strategy failed: alt coins move with Bitcoin anyway, Bitcoin appreciates fastest, and you never know which alt will win (and diversified investment always gives mediocre return)
    There are so many indicators: you have to read the market through news, Elon Musk, coinmarketcap/premiums, and prices/quantities

2021-03-03
- Let's study path set-up in linux and virtualenv and sudo/account setting as well
- Let's use virtualenv, otherwise it could be disaster later

2021-03-07
- A good feeling about life and style
    Thom Brown is so pretty (in combination with Gucci sneakers) with white skin, slender legs, pretty face, and round head with long hair - reminds me of HY
    Choose my style and keep working toward it - wear good ones and maintain style / neatness
    Aim high / search diligently / move on with determination 
    Consider SMART-LASIK (in the range of 250)
- Investment related
    Divided my assets into two categories: stock and coin
        * stock: HMM - 300M KRW
        * coin: BTC - 600M KRW
    Principle driven management is required
        * if fear or greed drive/motivates actions, such actions surely fail
        * I have multiple experiences of such failures - have to learn from experience
        * Do not let emotion replace logic, and in order for that use order reservations in coinone
    I have to recall my rationales and feelings in order avoid the same mistakes
        * first: 
        * second: 
        ... 
    Should aware my risk taking is getting bigger and bold
    After all, my adjustment decisions only reduced the number of BTCs I could've own if I just hold
- Roadmap for my journey to achieve goals
    1. Develop issuetracker in issuetracker.info
    2. Manage account with issuetree.tracker@gmail.com
    3. Write things 
    4. Written things will be the source of video for Youtube: prepare for Youtube
    5. Develop systems for autotrading: kiwoom and Coinone
- Images for future
    Have to make overwhelming amount of money
    Have to be sustainable 
    Have to interact with people online and/or offline
    Engage with technology

2021-08-19
- I came back to this note in 5 months
- I read first part of the note, and realized that the life hasn't been changed a bit since then
- I have the same concerns as I had in 2021-02
- What a shame / there is no progress
- No clear idea what to do, what to develop, and what target to hold
- Just waiting for KDBL issue to clear, but what next?
- YA Kim, JS Lee, HY, ES etc the same situations stay
- Investment is a big part but no rational and clear approach developed since then
- Mediocre outcomes in investments

2023-10-15
- Been a while since I started my own-business: tnpartners.net
- No obvious achievement yet, but making progresses little by little
- However, it seems there has been little to no improvement in my knowledge and knowhow, especially in terms of finance; I need to put more effort into building a solid foundation of financial knowledge and knowhow, as well as developing firm determination and disiplined principles.
